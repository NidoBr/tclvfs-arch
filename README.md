# tclvfs-arch
## PKGBUILD for TclVFS (Virtual Filesystem extension for Tcl) on Arch Linux

## Dependencies:
```
tcl 8.4.x or higher
bash
base-devel 
```

## This package provides the **vfs** extension for Tcl.

#### https://www.tcl-lang.org/

## Since I couldn't find a native package, and the installation isn't very intuitive, I created a PKGBUILD to make it easier.


### Note: At this time, the "[tcl](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/tcl)" package is in the Arch Linux repositories, "[tcllib]()" is only in the AUR, and "tclvfs" is not in either.
