# tclvfs-arch
## PKGBUILD for TclVFS (Virtual Filesystem extension for Tcl) on Arch Linux

## Dependencies:
```
tcl 8.4.x or higher
bash
base-devel 
```

## This package provides the **vfs** extension for Tcl.

## Since I couldn't find a native package, and the installation isn't very intuitive, I created a PKGBUILD to make it easier.
